## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a results-driven **Senior DevOps Engineer** with strong experience designing secure, scalable, and production-grade cloud infrastructure.

I specialize in:

- 🏗 Designing reusable CI/CD pipelines
- ☁️ AWS cloud architecture & automation
- 🐳 Containerization & Kubernetes
- 🔐 Secure secret management & DevSecOps
- 🛠 Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, Packer, Ansible)
- 🗄 Database deployment automation (Liquibase)

I focus on building **enterprise-ready, production-hardened systems**, not just pipelines.

## 🧠 What I Bring to the Table

✔ Multi-environment CI/CD architecture (INT → TST → PRD)  
✔ Secure secret handling using AWS Secrets Manager  
✔ Golden AMI creation with Packer + Hardening  
✔ Kubernetes Stateful vs Stateless architecture  
✔ GitHub reusable workflows & composite actions  
✔ AWS ECR, ECS, EKS automation  
✔ Liquibase DB automation via GitHub Actions  
✔ DevSecOps integrations (Snyk, scanning, compliance)
